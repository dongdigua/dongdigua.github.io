#+TITLE: New Blog Architecture
#+DESCRIPTION: It's time
#+DATE: <2022-11-20 Sun>

I've never fully learnt git before(only search for garbage when meeted with problem), so I recently read [[https://git-scm.com/book][ProGit]].
And I have some good ideas on my repo architecture: I should make use of branch, obviously.

* Idea is:
seperate the source file(org) and the generated files(html, feed.xml)
so I can
** clearly look at the diff
** delete the generated files if I want
because those static files are really unecessary and takes much space

* So what
** use =filter-branch= to remove the huge =feed.xml= in the full history
** ignore the generated files in the source repo
** merge the source repo into site repo when I think it's ok
don't remove the source(org) in the site repo,
if build in main and checkout to site, those html will be overwritten
** and I will use the same stratagy on my YW sub-website if there's no problem

* Need Advice
I'm really new to do this.
If you have a better idea, or this is somehow useful to you,
*contact me, please!*

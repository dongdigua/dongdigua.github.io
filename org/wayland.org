#+TITLE: Something About Wayland(swaywm)
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil \n:t

* Solution
** gnome-screenshot
grim
** iBus
emacs pyim
** Emacs transparent
probably wayfire?
** Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified
*** =sudo -E=
*** lxpolkit(directly execute) or polkit-gnome(prettier)
** cannot start sway on lightdm
in =/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf= uncomment =sessions-directory= line
but still not stable, and it can't remenber which DE you used last time
+so use gdm is a better choice?+
SDDM is fantastic! [[https://youtu.be/2p7FINJSlAk][It is themeable]],
I'm using *~elarun~*, a oxygen-like smooth crystal theme
materia-kde is also a good choice
** obs
don't remove the =include= line!!!
** cursor theme not working
[[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/6931][from this issue]]
add =seat seat0 xcursor_theme Oxygen_White= in sway comfig file
** touchpad gesture like gnome

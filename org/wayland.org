* Solution
** iBus

emacs pyim
** Emacs transparent, terminal blur
sway can't, probably wayfire?
** Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified
*** =sudo -E=
*** lxpolkit(directly execute) or polkit-gnome(prettier, at /usr/libexec/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1)
** cannot start sway on lightdm
yes, still not stable, and it can't remenber which DE you used last time
+so use gdm is a better choice?+
SDDM is fantastic! [[https://youtu.be/2p7FINJSlAk][It is themeable]],
I'm using *~elarun~*, a oxygen-like smooth crystal theme, materia-kde is also a good choice
** obs
don't remove the =include= line in sway/config
** cursor theme not working
[[https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/6931][from this issue]]
add =seat seat0 xcursor_theme Oxygen_White= in sway config file
** touchpad gesture like gnome
use libinput-gestures

mako, a notification daemon
** TODO [[https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/issues/1329][Wayfire crashes when closing foot terminal]]
** emacs tool-bar not working(cannot toggle and icon theme missing)
*** cannot toggle: disable custon =default-frame-alist=, or just use floating mode
*** TODO icon theme missing: ?

this feature is not compatible with i3, so sway didn't accept the pr
